Issues: I'm pretty sure it's working 100% but Me and this Ta tried to fix it on Thursday and he said that he was confused because the code is so weird and it's hard to understand. We couldn't figure it out as to why it was crashing so if you do run into any errors then the rest will still work because I moved all the code to a new program.
